# The Smart One MT5 - ReadMe File

This ReadMe file provides an overview of the code for The Smart One MT5, a forex trading robot developed by the Forex Robot Easy Team. The code is designed to implement an intelligent order placement system and a drawdown reduction function to optimize trade execution and protect the trader's investment.

## Intelligent Order Placement System

The `CalculateLotSize()` function is responsible for dynamically calculating the traded lot size based on market conditions. This ensures that the robot adjusts its trading volume according to prevailing market conditions, optimizing trade execution. The code for dynamically calculating the lot size is implemented within this function.

## Drawdown Reduce Function

The `ReduceDrawdown()` function minimizes the drawdown of the deposit by partially closing orders in a series to reduce risk. This function protects the trader's investment by closing a portion of the open trades during periods of market volatility. The code for closing orders in a series to reduce drawdown is implemented within this function.

## Main Program

The main program consists of three essential functions - `OnInit()`, `OnTick()`, and `OnDeinit()`.

### OnInit()

The `OnInit()` function is called during the initialization of the robot. This function contains the initialization code required for the proper functioning of the robot. Additionally, it calls the `CalculateLotSize()` function to calculate the initial lot size based on current market conditions.

### OnTick()

The `OnTick()` function is called on every tick of the market. This function implements the trading logic of the robot. It first calls the `ReduceDrawdown()` function to reduce drawdown during periods of market volatility. Then, it places orders based on the calculated lot size and optimizes trade execution. The trading logic code is implemented within this function.

### OnDeinit()

The `OnDeinit()` function is called during the deinitialization of the robot. This function contains the deinitialization code required to clean up any resources used by the robot.

## Product Description
